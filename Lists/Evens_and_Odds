EVENS AND ODDS
You've been asked to write a program that will calculate how many odd and even numbers exist in a list.

CHALLENGE
Write the get_odds_and_evens function to loop through the numbers list and check if each number in the list is either odd or even.

Increment the num_evens counter if even, and the num_odds counter if it's odd. Lastly, return the two values num_odds and num_evens in that order.

TIP
Remember, you can check if a number is even by using the modulo operator (%).


def get_odds_and_evens(numbers):
    # Step 1: Initialize counters
    num_odds = 0
    num_evens = 0

    # Step 2: Loop through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Step 3: Check if the number is even using the modulo operator
        if number % 2 == 0:
            # Step 4: Increment the num_evens counter
            num_evens += 1
        else:
            # Step 5: Increment the num_odds counter
            num_odds += 1

    # Step 6: Return the counts of odds and evens
    return num_odds, num_evens

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
result = get_odds_and_evens(numbers)
print(result)
# Output: (5, 4)  # There are 5 odd numbers and 4 even numbers in the list
